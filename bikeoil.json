Lasts longer, doesn't gunk up, and resists UK weather like no other. May seem a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way.","rating":"5"},{"id":"490","product_id":"bikeoil","nickname":"Gereatric63","review":"Have been using this lube for the past 4 months and found it does not attract dirt on the chain and gives a super smooth ride. For the price this is an excellent product.","rating":"5"},{"id":"491","product_id":"bikeoil","nickname":"NotHappy123","review":"Nozzle breaks easily.
